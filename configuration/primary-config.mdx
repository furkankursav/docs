`PDA_FDM_PrimaryConfig` is the main configuration data asset for the Flexible Directional Menu system.

![image51](/images/image51.png)

It defines global behavior, layout rules, and default settings mostly used by `AC_FDM_Component`, `WBP_FDM_Widget`, `WBP_FDM_CarouselSlotContainer`.

It is the central place where designers and developers configure how the menu behaves, looks, and resolves placements — without modifying code or blueprints.

You can find example Configs in `FlexibleDirectionalMenu/Configuration/Configs`.
