title: 'Location & Placement'

`AC_FDM_Component` does not hardcode where entries should be placed.  
Instead, it uses layout configuration data to determine placement rules at runtime.

Each entry provides entry metadata and the component resolves a suitable container location based on the active configuration.

The order of layout definitions inside the layout data is significant.

Layout Data entries are processed sequentially in the order they appear in the configuration. The first matching layout entry will be used first when creating a placement for a container.

This means that layout definitions earlier in the list have higher priority and will be created first.

Example:

Consider the following layout configuration entries:

- `FDM.Layout.Right.1`  
- `FDM.Layout.Right.2`  

Since `FDM.Layout.Right.1` added before `FDM.Layout.Right.2` in the configuration, it will:

- Be initialized earlier  
- Appear closer to the center of the menu  

As a result, `FDM.Layout.Right.1` will be placed closer to the D-Pad center than `FDM.Layout.Right.2`.

but if you put the `FDM.Layout.Right.2` above in Layout Data, the menu will look like that.

In other words, the numbers in the slot tags are not subject to any sequential ordering. What matters is the order in the Layout Data.

Also, you don't have to use direction and container indexes to these tags as in the example. If you wish, you can use tags like `FDM.Layout.Riffle`, `FDM.Layout.Pistol`, `FDM.Layout.Throwables`. 

This ordering rule allows designers to control layout order simply by rearranging layout entries in the configuration, without changing code.

The component maintains the mapping between:

- Entry(Object) -> Location(S_FDM_EntryLocation)  
- Container Location(S_FDM_ContainerLocation) -> Slot Count(int)  
- Container Location(S_FDM_ContainerLocation) -> Active Slot Index(int)  

This ensures fast queries in both directions and enables robust runtime operations like add/remove/swap/move.

A container location represents:

- Direction(Up, Right, Down, Left)  
- Container Index within that direction

These are the slot containers. The number represents the container index.

and these are the slot widgets in the Left, 0 container. 

Direction, Container Index, Slot Index.
