title: 'CRUD Operations'
---
`AC_FDM_Component` manages the menu’s entries and their placements. It supports runtime operations such as:

- Add entries  
- Remove entries  
- Move entries to new locations  
- Swap entry locations  

Entries are standard `UObject` instances that implement the entry interface `BPI_FDM_Entry`. The component treats entries as **data + behavior providers**, while the UI is responsible for visualization.

#### Adding Entry

When a new entry has been added, “On Entry Added” interface function gets called on SourceObject and the “OnNewEntryAdded(Added Entry)”  event gets triggered.

#### Removing Entry

When you remove an entry, “On Entry Removed” interface function gets called and the “OnEntryPlacementsChanged(ChangedEntries)” event gets triggered.

#### Getting An Entry / Location

You can use some query functions for that.

#### Changing An Entry’s Location

You can use “Move Entry To Location” to move an entry to a specific location. If there is already an entry in the new location, it will swap their locations automatically.
