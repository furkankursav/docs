### Entry Location (S_FDM_EntryLocation)

Each Entry is placed into a **Location**, defined by

- Direction : E_FDM_Direction(Up, Right, Down, Left)  
- Container Index: integer  
- Slot Index: integer  

Each Entry location is determined by the AC_FDM_Component at runtime by order of adding and according to Config asset which I will explain later in the document. But you will see that the system allows changing Entry locations at runtime. So it is not fixed/static.
