title: Slot Container Direction Group
---

`WBP_FDM_SlotContainerDirectionGroup` is just a layout helper widget used by `WBP_FDM_Widget` to organize and arrange multiple Slot Containers within a single direction.

Each Direction Group represents one direction (Up, Down, Left, or Right) and acts as a visual container that holds one or more `WBP_FDM_SlotContainer` widgets.

TL;DR: You do NOT need to touch this widget.

#### Purpose

Slot Containers must be arranged in a strict order (side-by-side or top-to-bottom) depending on their direction. To achieve this, each direction group internally uses a layout panel:

- Horizontal Box for Left / Right directions  
- Vertical Box for Up / Down directions  

However, standard layout panels always insert children in the same logical direction:

- Horizontal Box: left to right  
- Vertical Box: top to bottom  

For some directions (specifically Left and Down), this default ordering is visually inverted relative to the desired menu layout.

#### Directional Layout Inversion

To ensure correct visual ordering:

- The Left direction group draws its containers in reverse horizontal order.  
- The Down direction group draws its containers in reverse vertical order.

This inversion ensures that containers visually expand outward from the central D-Pad reference, regardless of the underlying layout panel behavior.

#### Responsibilities

`WBP_FDM_SlotContainerDirectionGroup` is responsible for:

- Hosting `WBP_FDM_SlotContainer` widgets for a specific direction  
- Inserting containers into the correct layout panel (horizontal or vertical)  
- Reversing insertion order when necessary (Left and Down)  
- Maintaining consistent spacing and alignment per direction  

It does not contain selection logic, gameplay logic, or slot-level behavior.
