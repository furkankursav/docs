By default, Flexible Directional Menu spawns and manages its own main UI wrapper widget (`WBP_FDM_MainHUD`). This behavior is determined by the **Use System Defined Main Widget** boolean inside the primary config data asset.

When this option is enabled, the system:

- Spawns `WBP_FDM_MainHUD` during initialization,  
- Adds it to the viewport,  
- Retrieves the internal `WBP_FDM_Widget` instance from it and uses it as the menu UI.

This setup is intended for quick integration and prototyping.

However, in many projects you will already have a main HUD widget (e.g. a gameplay HUD showing health, loadout, objectives, etc.), and you may want the FDM menu to be embedded inside that existing widget instead of using the system-defined one.

### Using Your Own Main / Wrapper / Root Widget

To use your own main widget instead of `WBP_FDM_MainHUD`, follow these steps:

#### Step 1 — Add `WBP_FDM_Widget` to your own HUD

Inside your own main widget (for example `WBP_GameplayHUD`):

- Add `WBP_FDM_Widget` as a child widget.  
- Position and size it as desired (anchors, alignment, scale, etc.).  
- Make sure it is created and added to the viewport as part of your normal HUD flow.

#### Step 2 — Disable the system-defined main widget

In your primary config data asset:

- Set **Use System Defined Main Widget** to **false**.

#### Step 3 — Implement the Component Owner Interface

On the actor that owns the `AC_FDM_Component` (usually the Player Character or Player Controller):

- Implement the `BPI_FDM_ComponentOwner` interface.  
- Implement the function `Get FDM Widget`.  
- Return the reference to the `WBP_FDM_Widget` instance that you added to your own HUD.

This allows the component to retrieve and control the correct menu widget without knowing about your HUD structure.
